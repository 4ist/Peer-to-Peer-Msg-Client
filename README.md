# Peer to Peer messaging client

Created 18 December 2018

This is a peer to peer messaging client that utilizes the following libraries:

Pygame: GUI
Socket: sockets; enables peer to peer communication
Multithreading: Allows simultaneous sends and receives

In testing I used static ports; the uploaded version takes in source port, dest port, and dest IP from the command line.

This project's goal was to integrate the three previously mentioned libraries together.
